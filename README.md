heartbleed-masstest
===================

This repo contains a script to automatically test sites for vulnerability to the [Heartbleed Bug (CVE-2014-0160)](http://heartbleed.com/).

This repo was created in a separate part as an initiative to track the top sites in the MENA region. Our work is based on the script test found here: ([https://github.com/musalbas/heartbleed-masstest](https://github.com/musalbas/heartbleed-masstest))

This repo also contains test results for the Alexa top 500 sites in the MENA region as of around April 10, 17:00 UTC. **Websites listed
as vulnerable may no longer be vulnerable. This list serves as a snapshot of
vulnerable sites at the time of the scan.**

**This is not a tracker which tracks which sites are vulnerable or not over time, but shows which sites have been affected.**

To check if a site is still vulnerable, you may use the tool at http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/.

Please note that subdomains aren't tested, so sites that don't have SSL on their main domain will appear as "no SSL".
